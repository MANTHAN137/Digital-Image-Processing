# Digital-Image-Processing
Digital Image Processing means processing digital image by means of a digital computer. We can also say that it is a use of computer algorithms, in order to get enhanced image either to extract some useful information. 

 Digital image processing is the use of algorithms and mathematical models to process and analyze digital images. The goal of digital image processing is to enhance the quality of images, extract meaningful information from images, and automate image-based tasks.

The basic steps involved in digital image processing are:
Image acquisition: This involves capturing an image using a digital camera or scanner, or importing an existing image into a computer.
Image enhancement: This involves improving the visual quality of an image, such as increasing contrast, reducing noise, and removing artifacts.
Image restoration: This involves removing degradation from an image, such as blurring, noise, and distortion.
Image segmentation: This involves dividing an image into regions or segments, each of which corresponds to a specific object or feature in the image.
Image representation and description: This involves representing an image in a way that can be analyzed and manipulated by a computer, and describing the features of an image in a compact and meaningful way.
Image analysis: This involves using algorithms and mathematical models to extract information from an image, such as recognizing objects, detecting patterns, and quantifying features.
Image synthesis and compression: This involves generating new images or compressing existing images to reduce storage and transmission requirements.
Digital image processing is widely used in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, computer vision, and multimedia.
